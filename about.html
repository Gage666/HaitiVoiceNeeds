	<hr />
	<p>
		This site was developed during the <a href="http://wiki.crisiscommons.org/wiki/Boston01232010">CrisisCampBoston</a>
		event on January 23, 2010 to address the <em>last mile</em> bottleneck of
		capturing the needs of the Haitian people after the earthquake.  In
		particular, it avoids the need for computerized data entry systems on
		the ground, and instead allows Haitians to state
		their needs using nothing more than a regular phone call and their
		voice.  We take transcriptions of calls and pass them on to data aggregators who help co-ordinate the response on the ground in Haiti.
