<p>Haiti Voice Needs has a transcription service that takes a url to
  an audio file and a callback url.  We list the audio files on our
  site, where volunteer Creole speakers listen to them and enter a
  transcription.  When someone transcribes an audio file, we store the
  transcription in our database and also send a GET request to the
  callback url associated with the audio file.  We can't guarantee
  when the transcription will be completed-it's all done by human
  volunteers, but whenever it finishes, we send the data back to
  your server so you can integrate the response into your data.
</p>
<p>So--how to you use us?  We'll give you a real-world example:
<b>Andy</b> is a field reporter working with an NGO in Haiti, recording Haitians'
stories of the quake and their ongoing struggle.  His organization
wants to put the stories online and make them search-able, but they
need them transcribed in order to do that.  <b>Andy</b> takes the MP3 files
he records in the field and puts them online in a directory on his
server, <i>http://www.haitianstories.org/stories</i>.  He then creates
a database table that has a field for the URL of his recording and the
text transcription.  He also writes a script on his server that can
receive a GET request with transcribed data and insert that into his
database.  If this is too technical, don't sweat it.  We have code
below that you can run on any server that has php and mysql.  Then, to
start the transcription process, he sends an HTTP request(GET or POST
is fine) to <i>http://www.haitivoiceneeds.org/submit.php</i> with
three parameters:<br/>
<ul>
<li><b>recording_url:</b>  This is an absolute link to his recordings
  online.  We accept pretty much all recording formats except
  for Real Audio.</li>
<li><b>callback_url:</b>  This is the absolute link to the
  script <b>Andy</b> made on his server.  When we finish transcribing,
  we'll pass the data back to this script.</li> 
<li><b>source:</b>  This is his organization's name.  It's optional,
  but it helps us track who's using our service</li>
</ul>
If the request comes through OK and we're able to enter it into our
database, we respond with 'ok'.
</p>
<p>Once <b>Andy</b> sends us this data, we'll add his recordings to
  our queue of audio to be transcribed.  Everything gets transcribed
  in the order it's received.  Once someone transcribes his recording,
  we send a GET request to the callback URL he provided.  The GET
  request has two parameters:<br/>
<ul>
<li><b>transcription:</b>  This is the actual text of the transcription</li>
<li><b>recording_url:</b>  This is the recording url that <b>Andy</b>
  sent us earlier.  We sent it back to he knows what file to pair the
  transcription with</li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr>
<center><h2>Example Code</h2></center>
<b>Making a request:</b>  
Making a request is pretty easy--the simplest way to do it is to 
make a GET request in php.  

<pre>
$rootDirectory="http://www.haitianstories.org/";  //the root url of
Andy's server
$audioDirectory="audio/";  //the relative path to the directory where he stores his recordings
$recordings=dirList($audioDirectory);
$callback_url=$rootDirectory."callback.php";  //the function that
stores the transcription data on ben's server
$submit_url="http://www.haitivoiceneeds.org/submit.php"; //the Haiti
Voice Needs submission URL
$source="Haitian Stories"; //Andy's organization
foreach($recordings as $recording)
{
   $recording_url=$rootDirectory.$audioDirectory.$recording;
   header("location: $submit_url?recording_url=$recording_url&callback_url=$callback_url&source=$source");
}

function dirList ($directory) 
{
    // create an array to hold directory list
    $results = array();

    // create a handler for the directory
    $handler = opendir($directory);

    // keep going until all files in directory have been read
    while ($file = readdir($handler)) {

        // if $file isn't this directory or its parent, 
        // add it to the results array
        if ($file != '.' && $file != '..')
            $results[] = $file;
    }

    // tidy up: close the handler
    closedir($handler);

    // done!
    return $results;
}
</pre>

<p>This code goes through each file in his audio directory and submits
  it to our server.  It's not the most robust code--it doesn't make
  sure he's only submitting audio files, and it doesn't make sure the
  requests are going through, but it works</p>
<p>For <b>Andy's</b> callback function, he's going to write a script
  that inserts the information Haiti Voice sends him into a database.
  Let's assume he has a table called 'recordings' in a mysql database set up with three columns:
<ul>
<li><i>id</i> int auto-increment primary key-- this is the index of 
his database.  There's a unique ID for each recording</li>
<li><i>recording_url</i>  text -- this field holds the absolute url of 
his recordings</li>
<li><i>transcription</i>  text -- this field holds the transcription 
that Haiti Voice sends back</li>
</ul>
<p>So now, Andy needs a script that takes in the two parameters Haiti
  Voice returns--'recording_url' and 'transcription', and inserts them
into his database</p>
<pre>
$connection = mysql_connect('localhost', 'andy', 'andypassword' or die ('Error connecting to mysql');
mysql_select_db('haitianStories', $connection);

$recording_url=$_GET['recording_url'];
$transcription=$_GET['transcription'];

//you'll want to sanitize the values before inserting them into the
database.  I'm leaving that out here for simplicity

$query="insert into recordings(recording_url, transcription)
values('$recording_url', '$transcription')";
mysql_query($query);
</pre>
