		Haiti Voice Needs has a transcription service that takes a url to
		an audio file and a callback url.  We list the audio files on our
		site, where volunteer Creole speakers listen to them and enter a
		transcription.  When someone transcribes an audio file, we store the
		transcription in our database and also send a GET request to the
		callback url associated with the audio file.  We can't guarantee
		when the transcription will be completed-it's all done by human
		volunteers, but whenever it finishes, we send the data back to
		your server so you can integrate the response into your data.
	</p>
	<p>
		So--how to you use us?  We'll give you a real-world example:
		<strong>Andy</strong> is a field reporter working with an NGO in Haiti, recording Haitians'
		stories of the quake and their ongoing struggle.  His organization
		wants to put the stories online and make them search-able, but they
		need them transcribed in order to do that.  <strong>Andy</strong> takes the MP3 files
		he records in the field and puts them online in a directory on his
		server, <em>http://www.haitianstories.org/stories</em>.  He then creates
		a database table that has a field for the URL of his recording and the
		text transcription.  He also writes a script on his server that can
		receive a GET request with transcribed data and insert that into his
		database.  If this is too technical, don't sweat it.  We have code
		below that you can run on any server that has php and mysql.  Then, to
		start the transcription process, he sends an HTTP request(GET or POST
		is fine) to <em>http://www.haitivoiceneeds.org/submit.php</em> with
		three parameters:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>recording_url:</strong>  This is an absolute link to his recordings
			online.  We accept pretty much all recording formats except
			for Real Audio.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>callback_url:</strong>  This is the absolute link to the
			script <strong>Andy</strong> made on his server.  When we finish transcribing,
			we'll pass the data back to this script.
		</li> 
		<li>
			<strong>source:</strong>  This is his organization's name.  It's optional,
			but it helps us track who's using our service
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		If the request comes through OK and we're able to enter it into our
		database, we respond with 'ok'.
	</p>

	<p>
		Once <strong>Andy</strong> sends us this data, we'll add his recordings to
		our queue of audio to be transcribed.  Everything gets transcribed
		in the order it's received.  Once someone transcribes his recording,
		we send a GET request to the callback URL he provided.  The GET
		request has two parameters:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>transcription:</strong> This is the actual text of the transcription</li>
		<li>
			<strong>recording_url:</strong> This is the recording url that <strong>Andy</strong>
			sent us earlier.  We sent it back to he knows what file to pair the
			transcription with
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 style="text-align:center;">Example Code</h2>

	<strong>Making a request:</strong>  
	Making a request is pretty easy--the simplest way to do it is to 
	make a GET request in php.  

	<pre>
		$rootDirectory="http://www.haitianstories.org/";  //the root url of
		Andy's server
		$audioDirectory="audio/";  //the relative path to the directory where he stores his recordings
		$recordings=dirList($audioDirectory);
		$callback_url=$rootDirectory."callback.php";  //the function that
		stores the transcription data on ben's server
		$submit_url="http://www.haitivoiceneeds.org/submit.php"; //the Haiti
		Voice Needs submission URL
		$source="Haitian Stories"; //Andy's organization
		foreach($recordings as $recording)
		{
		   $recording_url=$rootDirectory.$audioDirectory.$recording;
		   header("location: $submit_url?recording_url=$recording_url&callback_url=$callback_url&source=$source");
		}
		
		function dirList ($directory) 
		{
		    // create an array to hold directory list
		    $results = array();
		
		    // create a handler for the directory
		    $handler = opendir($directory);
		
		    // keep going until all files in directory have been read
		    while ($file = readdir($handler)) {
		
		        // if $file isn't this directory or its parent, 
		        // add it to the results array
		        if ($file != '.' && $file != '..')
		            $results[] = $file;
		    }
		
		    // tidy up: close the handler
		    closedir($handler);
		
		    // done!
		    return $results;
		}
	</pre>

	<p>
		This code goes through each file in his audio directory and submits
		it to our server.  It's not the most robust code--it doesn't make
		sure he's only submitting audio files, and it doesn't make sure the
		requests are going through, but it works
	</p>
	
	<p>
		For <strong>Andy's</strong> callback function, he's going to write a script
		that inserts the information Haiti Voice sends him into a database.
		Let's assume he has a table called 'recordings' in a mysql database set up with three columns:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>id</em> int auto-increment primary key-- this is the index of 
				his database.  There's a unique ID for each recording
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>recording_url</em>  text -- this field holds the absolute url of 
			his recordings
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>transcription</em>  text -- this field holds the transcription 
			that Haiti Voice sends back
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		So now, Andy needs a script that takes in the two parameters Haiti
		Voice returns--'recording_url' and 'transcription', and inserts them
		into his database
	</p>
	
	<pre>
		$connection = mysql_connect('localhost', 'andy', 'andypassword' or die ('Error connecting to mysql');
		mysql_select_db('haitianStories', $connection);
		
		$recording_url=$_GET['recording_url'];
		$transcription=$_GET['transcription'];
		
		//you'll want to sanitize the values before inserting them into the
		database.  I'm leaving that out here for simplicity
		
		$query="insert into recordings(recording_url, transcription)
		values('$recording_url', '$transcription')";
		mysql_query($query);
	</pre>
