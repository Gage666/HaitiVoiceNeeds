<p><b>Haiti Voice Needs</b> is a service that lets earthquake survivors in Haiti
<b>make requests</b> and <b>provide information</b> just by <b>making a phone call</b>.  
We have a toll-free number, <b>+1 (877) 286-0676</b> that Haitians can
call and record updates.  We then translate and transcribe the Haitian
creole into english and pass the information on to data aggregators
such as <b><a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/" target="_BLANK">Ushahidi</a></b>
and <b><a href="http://haiticrisis.appspot.com/" target="_BLANK">Google Person
    Finder</a></b>.
</p>
<p>
Our transcription is done by <b>bilingual volunteers</b>.  We have an
interface that gives a translator a Creole audio clip and a place to
enter the transcription.  We <b>need Creole speakers</b> to volunteer just a
couple minutes of their time to transcribe one or two messages-the
information they translate could save lives!  You can help out right
now by transcribing some of the messages at the bottom of this page
</p>
<p>
We've also created an <b>API</b> to open our service up to
developers.  We're set up to do <b>crowdsourced transcription</b> of
Creole recordings.  We have an <b>simple</b>, <b>free</b>
way for you to get quality transcriptions of your recordings.
