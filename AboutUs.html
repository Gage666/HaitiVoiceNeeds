<h1>About HaitiVoiceNeeds (HVN) Project</h1>
<hr>
This site was developed during the <a href="http://wiki.crisiscommons.org/wiki/Boston01232010">CrisisCampBoston</a> event on
January 23, 2010 to address the <i>last mile</i> bottleneck of
capturing the needs of the Haitian people after the earthquake.  In
particular, it avoids the need for computerized data entry systems on
the ground, and instead allows ordinary Haitians themselves to state
their needs using nothing more than a regular phone call and their
voice.
<p>
HVN is an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system that provides a
vocalized prompt in the language of the user's choosing (French/Creole
or English) for their name, location, contact info, and a statement of
their needs, and then captures the individual's needs in their own
language.  The telephony server then puts the request into a queue
(database) for response.  Separately, a web page presents the queue of
incoming voice requests to volunteer translators who convert the voice
recordings into text messages, and put them into an outgoing queue.
The outgoing queue then forwards the messages on to electronic
response systems like <a href="ushahidi.org">ushahidi.org</a> or
<a href="http://wehaveweneed.org">WeHaveWeNeed</a> where they can be acted on 
by rescue and recovery teams on the ground.
