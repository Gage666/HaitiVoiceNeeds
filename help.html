In the upcoming days, I see three big areas we need to work on, if we
want this to be a useful service:
<ul>
<li>The first one is getting a Haitian phone number that forwards to our
toll-free lines.  
We can't ask haitians to make international calls.  It's simply out of
the question.  
We need to partner with a local telecom or VOIP company to find a way to get local 
Haitian calls to us at no extra cost to the caller.</li>
<li>The second one is to start pulling together a community.  We 
need to identify other projects who can use our site (we need data 
coming in to our database to keep translators busy) and we need a
community 
of bilingual Creole speakers who can transcribe our text.  I think
there's a lot of haitians in the US who would help-the biggest risk in my mind
is pulling in too many translators too quickly.  I want there to
always be work on the site when a translator logs on. </li>
<li>Finally, we need to improve the user interface.  It needs to be 
painless for our volunteer translators to work for us.  I'm
inexperienced in UI design, and I think we'd really benefit from
 having a UI guy come in and redo the interface.  If any of you guys
  know someone who could do this work, that would be really
  helpful.</li></ul>
If you, or someone you know can help us in one of these ways, or if
you have other ideas you'd like to contribute, you can get in touch
with us
by <a href="mailto:haitivoiceneeds-prj@keithsteward.com">email</a> or
you can call Alex at 919.609.8744.  Thanks!
