		<strong>Haiti Voice Needs</strong> is a service that lets earthquake survivors in Haiti
		<strong>make requests</strong> and <strong>provide information</strong> just by
		<strong>making a phone call</strong>. We have a toll-free number, <strong>+1 (877) 286-0676</strong>
		that Haitians can call and record updates.  We then translate and transcribe the Haitian
		creole into english and pass the information on to data aggregators such as
		<strong><a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/" target="_BLANK">Ushahidi</a></strong>
		and <strong><a href="http://haiticrisis.appspot.com/" target="_BLANK">Google Person Finder</a></strong>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Our transcription is done by <strong>bilingual volunteers</strong>.  We have an
		interface that gives a translator a Creole audio clip and a place to
		enter the transcription.  We <strong>need Creole speakers</strong> to volunteer just a
		couple minutes of their time to transcribe one or two messages-the
		information they translate could save lives!  You can help out right
		now by transcribing some of the messages at the bottom of this page
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We've also created an <strong>API</strong> to open our service up to
		developers.  We're set up to do <strong>crowdsourced transcription</strong> of
		Creole recordings.  We have an <strong>simple</strong>, <strong>free</strong>
		way for you to get quality transcriptions of your recordings.

		spec and examples of how to use it.
